<section><h2 id="intro"> Introduction </h2>
<p class="intro">Stefan Sagmeister is an Austrian born designer and practitioner based in New York. He is one of the most influential designers in today’s art/design world and is widely known for his eccentric, humorous and rather controversial design style.  He puts in incredible amount of thought in each piece of his work and makes an emotional connection with each project by truly understanding the purpose of the project. He manages to find ways to get people talking about his work through his unique style of design and the sense of humour that he incorporates in his work. He is a huge influencer and inspiration to many modern designers in today’s world including myself. Something interesting about Stefan Sagmeister is that he chooses to go on a year-long sabbatical every seven years or so where he does not take work from any clients, he chooses to do this so he can explore things that he doesn’t have time to explore when the studio is running fulltime. He believes that this gap allows him to reassess and learn from his mistakes and refreshes his ideas so he can continue to produce work that elevates him to the top and keeps him at the peak of the design industry.</p></section>

<h2 id="story"> Story </h2>
        <p>Stefan Sagmeister was born in Bregenz a city at the eastern end of the Lake Constance in Austria in 1962 where he started his incredible journey. He began his career at the young age of 15 when he started writing articles and designing layouts for a local youth magazine called Alphorn. During his experience he realised that design and layout interested him a lot more than writing articles and decided that he wanted to pursue it. In his earlier years he was extremely interested in music and also played for a few bands, this further resulted in him finding interest in album cover design and through this was able to combine his love for both music and design.</p>
<p>When he turned 18 these interests led him to move to Vienna, Austria where he hoped of being accepted into the University of Applied Arts but he did not get accepted the first time he applied stating that “Just about everyone was better at drawing than I was.” He spent one year building up skill and learning at a local school nearby. He reapplied after completing the course at the school and got in the second time and went on to earn an M.B.A from the university.  He then went on to receive the prestigious Fulbright Scholarship to study graphic design at the Pratt Institute in New York.</p>
<p>In 1991, he went to Hong Kong to work for Leo Burnett’s advertising agency. The agency wanted Sagmeister to be a typographer for them and during his time working with them he worked on some controversial yet memorable projects, one of them being his poster design for the 1992 4A’s Advertising Awards Ceremony. The design consisted of an image of four nude Cantonese male’s backsides, this poster was extremely controversial and went so far that some of the agencies went on to boycott the award ceremony in protest of the poster. Sagmeister stated that this was one of the most commercial experiences of his life and in the time that he spent with the agency he learnt all about running a design studio and working in the design industry.</p>
<p>In 1993, Sagmeister returned to New York to work with M&Co who’s work he had been following for quite a while when he was a studying as it was run by his idol Tibor Kalman. Sagmeister also stated that “Tibor Kalman was the single most influential person in my design-y life and my one and only design hero.” Further, the studios work matched his smart, humorous, courageous and conceptual design style and brought out the best in him. One of the most notable examples of his work with the studio was his first project where he created an invitation for the Gay and Lesbian Taskforce Gala, his design consisted of a neatly packed small box of fruits. During his time working with the studio Sagmeister noticed that Kalman often gave him great advice which made a significant impact on him and influenced him in growing and thinking about his own career. Unfortunately this didn’t last long as M&Co unexpectedly disbanded and Sagmeister only got to work with his idol for around two months before Kalman moved to Rome to edit and work exclusively for Colours magazine for the Benetton group in Italy.</p>
<p>Sagmeister took his idols advice and decided to pursue his love for music and design.  He decided to setup his own design studio and proceeded to form the New York based Sagmeister Inc. in 1993. His studio was relatively small and consisted of only him and one intern, he worked on a number of different album covers and music projects at the time when CD covers where taking over from vinyl covers, CD covers were plain and boring and Sagmeister was able to re-imagine the covers which kick started his career. He then went on and did work for famous and renowned artists such as The Rolling Stones, Jay-Z, David Byrne, Aerosmith etc. He also admits that he initially found it really difficult to source work and did countless projects for smaller and lesser known artists. During this time he also did some branding, graphics and packaging work for clients as diverse as HBO, the Guggenheim Museum and Time Warner. In more recent times he added a partner and co-founded a design firm called Sagmeister&Walsh Inc. with Jessica Walsh in New York. Sagmeister&Walsh consider themselves a creative design agency that offer strategy and design production across all plat-forms, they offer services all the way from advertising, branding, packaging and concept development to website designing, film, furniture and also continue to design for the music industry.</p>
<p>Sagmeister believes in branching out and trying out new things his views changed a lot from the early 2000’s where he believed everything would be print based and print would last for a very long time, he encountered a different vision and decided to re-invent his practise, which now is very apparent with Sagmeister&Walsh as the agency seems to offer services across various different plat-forms.</p>
<p>Sagmeister takes a year-long sabbatical every seven years or so where he branches out and explores different opportunities, while many feel that this is quite bizzare and question whether the clients who rely on him would remain loyal during this period I feel like this shows how passionate Sagmeister truly is and shows that he is willing to take risks to better his work, An example of this is during his second sabbatical in Bali where he had a friend come over and look at his work which at the time was experimenting with furniture design. His friend thought he was wasting his time and although at the time that’s not something he wanted to hear he agreed that he had a point. Following this he soon experienced one of those “aha” moments and went with an idea to make a film about happiness called The Happy Film. The Happy Film was a huge success and premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. In the film Sagmeister goes on to define happiness and design and happiness in design. The reason he was so interested in doing a movie like this was because he knew he would have to do research that he normally would not have done.</p>

<p>Further Sagmeister goes on to state some of his rules to making more happiness</p>
<p>Rule 1: Thinking about ideas and content freely.                        Sagmeister believes that if there is no pressure and no time limit work comes out more naturally and there is an ease during the process of idea generation.</p>
<p>Rule 2: Travelling different places.                                                        He believes by travelling we are open to more influence from different places and that it help can improve idea generation and unblock creative block which is a very common problem that designers face in the modern world.</p>
<p>Rule 3: Using a variety of tools and techniques.                                    He believes by trying something new and not always staying digital we can come up with a various different outcomes that we normally would never have come up with.</p>
<p>Rule 4: Working on projects that matter to me.                                       He believes that often the best content that comes out of a designer is the content that is close to the designers heart and projects where the designer has an emotional connection with the work.</p>
<p>Rule 5: Having things come back from the printer done well.                           In recent times we have seen everything slowly become digital and in this time Sagmeister simply wants to feel the satisfaction of something that comes out as something physical like a fine printed book.</p>
<p>Rule 6: Get feedback from people who see our work.                                               He believes in working on projects that have visible physical and emotional impact.</p>
<p>Rule7:  Designing a project that feels partly brand new and partly familiar.

<h2 id="conclusion"> Conclusion </h2>                                                  <p>  He believes in doing things which are new but not completely new, he believes that doing repetitive things can cause habituation and totally new things can cause anxiousness so he suggests that we try something in the middle.</p>
<p>To conclude, the diversity of Sagmeister’s work shows how much of a unique talent he is and how far he is willing to go for success. Even though a lot of his work is driven by strong themes such as sexuality and humour I think there is a lot to learn from every piece of Sagmeister’s work that I have looked at, his unique methodology and creative process intrigues me and I think he is an absolute creative genius. I have learnt that taking risks and trusting your gut is one of the most important things, and I have also learnt about the power of taking time off and the importance of happiness in design. I also agree with Sagmeister that as a designer in the modern world one of our main tasks is for to see problems that are invisible because we as humans tend to habituate things to be able to learn new things. Habituation is not a bad thing but it definitely is not a good thing when we tend to un-see genuine problems. Lastly I agree with Sagmeister that as humans we have a negative bias and that we have to learn to make more happiness. Stefan Sagmeister is definitely a designer I will continue to keep interest in throughout my education and career and hope that I can use all that I have learnt as inspiration to be able to elevate my design work and career.</p>
